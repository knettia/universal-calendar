**What is the Universal Calendar?**

The **Universal Calendar** is a calendrical system I created myself with two main purposes:

1. Improved rest-day structure
2. More coherent historic notation

**How do the days look like?**

Unlike a traditional 7-day week, the Universal Calendar uses a 10-day "decade", akin to the the French Revolutionary. The days of the decade are named as follows:

| Days     |
|----------|
| Primidy  |
| Duody    |
| Tridy    |
| Quartidy |
| Quintidy |
| Sextidy  |
| Septidy  |
| Octidy   |
| Nonidy   |
| Decady   |

Tridy, Sextidy, and Decady are designated rest days.  

This promotes a 2-2-3 work-rest rhythm, ensuring that no more than three consecutive workdays ever occur.

**How do the months look like?**

The Universal Calendar has 10 months, modelled after the classic Roman calendar, omitting January and February:

| Months    | Days |
|-----------|------|
| March     | 36   |
| April     | 37   |
| May       | 36   |
| June      | 37   |
| July      | 36   |
| August    | 37   |
| September | 36   |
| October   | 37   |
| November  | 36   |
| December  | 37   |

Each month alternates between 36 and 37 days.

**How do the leap-years look like?**

Leap-years occur every 4 years, except if the year is divisible by 128. A leap year contains 366 days.

- The extra day is called the Interim Day.
- It is inserted between the 36th of July and the 1st of August.

Akin to the Frech Revolutionary, it is not part of any month, but also not part of any decade.

This means that such a circumstance would function like so:

36th of July, Sextidy -> Interim Day -> 1st of August, Septidy

**How do the epochs and notation look like?**

The Universal Calendar organizes history into four epochs:

| Epoch               | Abbreviation | Gregorian Range  | Year 1 Equivalent  |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Early Era           | EE           | Before 753 BCE   | 754 BCE = UC 1 EE  |
| Ante Modern Era     | AME          | 753 BCE - AD 528 | 753 BCE = UC 1 AME |
| Previous Modern Era | PME          | AD 529 - AD 1944 | AD 529 = UC 1 PME  |
| New Modern Era      | NME          | AD 1945 -        | AD 1945 = UC 1 NME |

the **Early Era**:

- Begins with 754 BCE
- Uses reverse counting

the **Ante Modern Era**:

- Begins with the founding of Rome (753 BCE)
- Ends with AD 528

the **Previous Modern Era**:

- Begins in AD 529, marking the Justinian Code and end of Roman paganism  
- Ends with AD 1944

the **New Modern Era**:

- Begins in AD 1945 with the end of WWII, founding of the UN, and atomic age
- 2025 Gregorian = UC 81 NME
